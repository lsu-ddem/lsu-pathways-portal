    content="The open-source curricula for the LSU STEM Pathway courses first took shape at Lee Magnet High School in Baton Rouge (Lee MHS) in collaboration with LSU faculty. In addition to taking courses in the four “core” subject areas—English language arts, math, science, and social studies—all students at Lee MHS take LSU STEM pathways courses in one of the following four Lee Academies: (1) Pre-Engineering, (2) Digital Media & Arts, (3) Computational Thinking & Computer Science, and (4) Biomedical Sciences.">

      <p>LSU Pathways 2019 Summer Institute </p>
      <p><em>May 28-July 3</em></p>
      <h2 id="ddem-summer-institute">DDEM Summer Institute</h2>
      <p>We are pleased to offer the 2019 Summer Institute for all teachers and schools wishing to offer the LSU Pathways courses in Digital Design &amp; Emergent Media (DDEM) </p>
      <p>We are seeking motivated and engaged high school teachers to develop the skills of emerging media practitioners. Participants do not need to have any background knowledge or prior training in Coding or Computer Science; the institute is designed to expand the technical training of those
        who
        already have an interest/practice in the media arts so that they can teach it more effectively and in an integrated way across the pathway. We expect teachers to attend the Summer Institute for two summers to complete training for 1 to 2 courses in their pathway.</p>
      <p>Most training sessions cover the entire 6 weeks. Each week contains 4 days of instruction, with a 5 day and 3 day week to end the institute before July 4th. (see schedule below) However a few of the courses are run in 3 week sessions, indicated in the listing below. We have found that the
        programming courses require significant practical experience and therefor necessitate ample time to work on developing assignments, examples, teaching materials, etc. If the schedule is prohibitive or you feel that you have ample experience in a particular area please contact us for
        possible
        accommodation. We will do what we can to allow you to participate as long as we feel assured that the quality of teaching will not suffer.</p>
      <p>Along with course specific training, everyone is required to participate in the DDEM program overview. Each morning and afternoon the entire cohort assembles to actively work through Digital Media and teaching issues that are similar across all courses and work on how to deal with a job
        field
        that is continually reinventing itself. We cover the design process, group dynamics, ideation and brainstorming, prototyping, iterative development and how to effectively guide and grade our project based learning process. For examples from our prior institute, see below...</p>
      <p>Session I: May 28 – June 13</p>
      <p>Session II: June 17 – July 3</p>
