    content="The open-source curricula for the LSU STEM Pathway courses first took shape at Lee Magnet High School in Baton Rouge (Lee MHS) in collaboration with LSU faculty. In addition to taking courses in the four “core” subject areas—English language arts, math, science, and social studies—all students at Lee MHS take LSU STEM pathways courses in one of the following four Lee Academies: (1) Pre-Engineering, (2) Digital Media & Arts, (3) Computational Thinking & Computer Science, and (4) Biomedical Sciences.">

      <p>Special notes on the <strong>Introduction to Engineering. (1) </strong>Monday 6/3 - Thursday 6/6 will be held at LSU in Baton Rouge. The program will cover the costs for a motel room (double occupancy). <strong>(2) </strong>Teachers who also take Math 2020, Module 2 (Geometry) will be
        accommodated in Baton Rouge during this period<strong>. (3) <em>This module will only run if at least 8 participants enroll.</em></strong></p>
      <p>Each module concentrates on a coherent group of topics, with emphasis on the guiding mathematical concepts and the relevance to the Louisiana Math Standards. Special attention is given to studying and understanding the kinds of questions that appear on the Praxis tests: Algebra (5162) and
        Secondary Mathematics Content (5161).</p>

      <p>Classes will meet on the LSU Shreveport campus, under the direction of Dr. James Madden and Dr. Frank Neubrander, with assistance from the LSU-S Department of Mathematics faculty. Any two modules may be taken for 3 hours of graduate credit in LSU Math 6303. All four modules may be taken for
        6
        hours of graduate credit in LSU Math 6303.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
      <p>In Session I, we will also offer a 12-day training for the LSU Stem Certification Pathway course <strong>“Introduction to Engineering,”</strong> <em>provided we have a minimum enrollment of eight teachers.</em> The training will be under the direction of Dr. Frank Neubrander and Dr. Craig
        Harvey
        with assistance of Ms. Vanessa Begat and other faculty members from the LSU College of Engineering. This training can also be taken for 3 hours of graduate credit in IE 4785 Special Topics: LSU Pre-Engineering Pathway. Participants will be required to spend 4 days in Baton Rouge (tentatively
        June
        3, 4, 5, 6) to participate in our main Intro to Engineering Summer Institute. The program will cover the costs for a motel room in Baton Rouge (double occupancy).</p>
      <p>The registration fee for a session is $1,920 per teacher. It is expected that some (most) teachers participate in both sessions ($3,840 for both sessions). <em>Should a participant want to receive graduate credit, he or she must enroll in the LSU Graduate School; see footnote 1 below.
          Additional
          LSU fees apply. Please contact Dr. James Madden at mmmad@lsu.edu if you are interested.</em> A teacher can earn 3 hours of graduate credit for either Session I or Session II ($434 in fees to be paid; $1,007 tuition will be covered through the registration fee). A teacher can earn 6 hours
        of
        credit when taking Sessions I and II ($1,086.20 in fees to be paid; $2201.80 tuition will be covered through the registration fee). Stipends for teachers will be determined and paid for by the school districts.</p>
      <p>High school students taking the LSU STEM Pathway course, <em>Introduction to Engineering,</em> during the school year with a trained teacher are eligible to earn LSU STEM Pathway Certificates, and the school district will receive $476 per student per course from the Louisiana Department of
        Education’s Career and Technical Education JumpStart funds. To register, please fill out the attached registration form and send it to <a href="mailto:fneubr1@lsu.edu">fneubr1@lsu.edu</a> .</p>

          <p> Participants who want to earn graduate credit should apply to the LSU graduate school. There are two options:</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Select the button for "domestic" or “international” (as appropriate) and the button for "non-degree-seeking". </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                  <p>When it appears, select the button for "Summer 2019".</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>When it appears, click on the bar that says "start application".</p>

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>There is an application fee of $50. Participants should complete their application as soon as possible, and in any case before the end of April. A GPA of at least 2.5 is required for admission. I can submit a petition for participants who do not meet this. We have a reasonable
                chance
                of
                succeeding in getting them in, based on a letter from me. Note that up to 12 hours of credit earned as a non-degree-seeking student can be applied later to a degree program, if one applies to and is accepted in one.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Participants who wish to start work toward a <strong>masters' degree</strong> or a <strong>graduate certificate</strong> this summer must apply by April 15. They should contact James Madden immediately by email (mmmad@lsu.edu) or phone (225-978-3525) for advice.</li>
