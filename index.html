              in collaboration with LSU faculty. In addition to taking courses in the four “core” subject areas—English
              language arts,
              math, science, and social studies—all students at Lee MHS take LSU STEM pathways courses in one of the
              following
              four Lee Academies: (1) Pre-Engineering, (2) Digital Media & Arts, (3) Computational Thinking & Computer
              Science,
              and (4) Biomedical Sciences.

            <h2>The LSU STEM Certification Pathways Program</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                provides high school students with the opportunity to enroll in a specialized progression of
                project-based courses (i.e.,
                pathways) to attain industry-promulgated and valued credentials, university issued certificates of
                course completion,
                or dual enrollment credit in order to graduate with either a career-tech diploma or to enhance their
                university-prep
                diploma,
              </li>
              <li>
                requires teachers who instruct the pathway courses to further their academic credentials by
                participating in intensive graduate-level
                LSU Pathway Training courses. If taken for credit, this program leads to a customized "Professional
                Graduate
                Certificate" issued by the LSU Colleges of Science or Engineering.
              </li>
              <li>
                provides school districts with additional state funding to support the Pathway courses and required
                teacher training. The
                Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) approved the LSU Pre-Engineering Pathway
                in June
                2017; the Digital Design & Emergent Media Certification Pathway is currently under consideration. Under
                provisions
                of the approved state education funding formula, a school district offering a BESE approved LSU Pathway
                course
                receives $480 per student per course in additional CTE base weight and Career Development Funds.
              </li>

          <p>
            We are seeking motivated and engaged high school teachers<sup><a href="#_1-note" id="1-source">1</a></sup>
            who are interested in facilitating LSU STEM Certification Pathway courses in Pre-Engineering, Digital Design & Emergent Media, Computing, or Biomedical Sciences in the 2019-20 school year. Participants do not need to have any
            background knowledge or prior training in Engineering, Digital Design, Computer Science, or Biomedical Sciences.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a school to be able to offer courses within the LSU Certification Pathway framework, teachers must become certified to teach a specific course at the LSU Pathways Summer Training Institute at Lee Magnet High School in Baton Rouge. Some courses require teachers to participate in a
            3-week
            training institute (yellow and blue cells below, 12 days); some courses require a 6-week training institute (green cells below; 24 days). The three week training institutes are from 5/28 - 6/13 and from 6/17 to 7/03; the six week institute is from 5/28 to 7/03.
          </p>

          <p>

            <!-- <img src="../img/summer-institute-schedule_Page_2.jpg" alt="summer institute schedule 2" class="img-responsive"> -->

          </p>

          <p>
            The registration fee for a three-week institute is $1,920 per teacher, for a six-week institute it is $3,840 per teacher. Should a participant want to receive graduate credit for the summer institute (most courses are eligible for graduate credit), the teacher must enroll in the LSU
            Graduate School
            and additional LSU fees apply ($434 for 3 hours of credit and $1086.20 for 6 hours of credit<sup><a href="#_2-note" id="2-source">2</a></sup>; please contact Dr. Frank Neubrander at fneubr1@lsu.edu if you are interested). If a teacher needs a dorm room on the LSU campus, the additional
            charges will be about $700 for a three week
            institute and
            $1,400 for a six-week institute. Stipends for teachers will be determined and paid for by the school districts.

          </p>
          <p>
            During the 2019-20 school year, participants also need to attend eight
            Saturday sessions (8am-noon) that are designed to assist with course implementation issues (participants who cannot travel to LSU will be able to participate virtually). There will be no charge for the Saturday
            sessions;
            stipends for teachers will be determined and paid for by the school districts.

          </p>
          <p>
            Students taking LSU STEM Pathway courses with a trained teacher will be eligible to earn LSU STEM Pathway Certificates and the school district will receive $476 per student per course from the Louisiana Department of Education’s Career and Technical Education JumpStart funds. A school
            does
            not
            have to commit to implement all of the Pathway courses; as long as any one Pathway course is taught by a trained teacher, the school district will receive $476 in JumpStart funding for each participating student receiving a LSU Certification of Course Completion.
          </p>

          <p>
            For a high school teacher to be able to participate, his/her high school must sign a <i>Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)</i> with LSU in which the school commits to <sup><a href="#_3-note" id="3-source">3</a></sup>
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              providing a dedicated computer lab or one-to-one technology usage with internet connectivity for students participating in the LSU STEM
              Certification Pathway program,
            </li>
            <li>
              piloting each course that the participating teacher is being trained for during the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school
              years, and
            </li>
            <li>
              paying LSU a $96 administrative fee for each student for which LSU issues a STEM Pathway
              Certificate of Course Completion and for which the school system receives $476 in JumpStart funding.
            </li>
          </ul>
