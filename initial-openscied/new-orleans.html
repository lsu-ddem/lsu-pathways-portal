    content="The open-source curricula for the LSU STEM Pathway courses first took shape at Lee Magnet High School in Baton Rouge (Lee MHS) in collaboration with LSU faculty. In addition to taking courses in the four “core” subject areas—English language arts, math, science, and social studies—all students at Lee MHS take LSU STEM pathways courses in one of the following four Lee Academies: (1) Pre-Engineering, (2) Digital Media & Arts, (3) Computational Thinking & Computer Science, and (4) Biomedical Sciences.">

        The LSU Cain Center is offering a 4-day workshop utilizing curricula developed by OpenSciEd. This professional development is specific to 6th, 7th, and 8th-grade science teachers interested in using OpenSciEd materials in their classrooms. Currently, training on 3 units is available:
        Metabolic, Thermal, and Sound. During registration, please select the ONE training that you will be attending. This is a round-one training, meaning it is most beneficial for teachers who are trying to develop a better understanding of instructional shifts in the new Louisiana standards, how OpenSciEd routines support those shifts and the resources available for planning, instruction, and assessment. For more information about OpenSciEd please visit: <a href="https://www.openscied.org/openscied/">https://www.openscied.org/openscied/</a>
