    content="The open-source curricula for the LSU STEM Pathway courses first took shape at Lee Magnet High School in Baton Rouge (Lee MHS) in collaboration with LSU faculty. In addition to taking courses in the four “core” subject areas—English language arts, math, science, and social studies—all students at Lee MHS take LSU STEM pathways courses in one of the following four Lee Academies: (1) Pre-Engineering, (2) Digital Media & Arts, (3) Computational Thinking & Computer Science, and (4) Biomedical Sciences.">

        The LSU Cain Center is offering a four-day workshop utilizing curricula developed by OpenSciEd. This professional development is specific to 6th, 7th, and 8th-grade science teachers interested in implementing OpenSciEd instruction in their classrooms. Note that Shell is sponsoring up to 25
        teachers who work in schools within its asset areas of West Baton Rouge, Ascension, and St James Parishes. Teachers working in schools outside of these parishes or if registration is filled in the asset areas, a reduced registration rate of $200 will apply for the four-day PD.
      </p>
      <p>
        The professional development will consist of the following units by grade: 6th-Sound, 7th-Thermal, and 8th-Metabolic. Please select the grade level you would prefer. This is a round-one training, so it is most beneficial for teachers who need to 1) develop a better understanding of the
        instructional shifts and practices within the new Louisiana standards, 2) learn how OpenSciEd routines support those shifts, and 3) how to use the resources available for planning, instructing and assessing student learning.
